# UFOs

## Objective
To create a webpage that provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  The filters will allow you to search using a single search feature, or any combination of the following: date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
In ordefor the table to return desired results, enter a date, city, state, country, or shape (or combination of criteria) for the UFO sightings you are interested in reviewing. Below are examples of how the search criteria will return different results.

**Example 1: Searching for sightings in the shape of a triange, yields the following results**

Enter *triangle* in the field hightlighted in yellow, press Enter. Check the Shape column to ensure the data matches your entry.

**Example 2: Continue to drilldown on sightings in the shape of a triangle, that only occurred in the state of MA, will yield the following results**

Leave *triangle* in the shape field hightlighted in yellow, then enter *ma* in the state filter highlighted in yellow, press Enter. Check the Shape & State column to ensure the data matches your entry.

**Example 3: Continue investigating UFO sightings that occurred in the state of MA, in any shape will yield the following results**

## Summary

In summary, this webpage allows access to data to become more accessible to the end user.  There are, however, drawbacks to this design and recommendations that could be made to further improve future development.

Drawback: Using the filter search, the data has to match exactly to the table. For example when selecting state, you must enter nj (as opposed to NJ). Incorrect use of capital letters or misspelled words may not yield any returns, when in fact there is applicable data to match your inquiry.

Recommendations for future development:
- Enhance the filter search with dropdown lists with city, state, country or shape data. This will enhance the search and eliminate the possiblity of errors as mentioned in the drawback.
- A filter search reset button could also be added, so that rather than clearing the data from each search location, all are cleared with the click of a button.
